// PAYMENT_ID feature bit is refused here rather than in go-tari-lib.

// lib's DammSum/Ristretto255-based validation, and returns the parsed
// address plus its canonical base58 form. Malformed input returns
// address.Address{} and the underlying parse error unchanged, so callers
// can render it directly rather than needing their own validation logic.
